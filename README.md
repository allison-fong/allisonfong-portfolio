# allisonfong-portfolio
greetings, earthlings and aliens! welcome to allison's shitshow :D follow along on my journey to code my own portfolio site. my background is in design, but i enjoy jumping head first into new experiences and discomfort. you are free to debate whether this is masochistic behavior or not. i hope to apply my basic frontend web development knowledge and pick up new skills along the way. please reach out with any feedback - i would love to hear about ways to improve my practice (design, coding, adulting, etc.)
